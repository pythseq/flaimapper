"""FlaiMapper: computational annotation of small ncRNA derived fragments using RNA-seq high throughput data

 Here we present Fragment Location Annotation Identification mapper
 (FlaiMapper), a method that extracts and annotates the locations of
 sncRNA-derived RNAs (sncdRNAs). These sncdRNAs are often detected in
 sequencing data and observed as fragments of their  precursor sncRNA.
 Using small RNA-seq read alignments, FlaiMapper is able to annotate
 fragments primarily by peak-detection on the start and  end position
 densities followed by filtering and a reconstruction processes.
