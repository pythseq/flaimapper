	* (v1.2.2) Added GTF/GFF as output format.

	* (v1.2.1) Output files are sorted on chromosome names. This ensures
	  that lines in the output file always appear in the same order.
	  Deriving GTF/GFF files from FASTA files has now the correct
	  1-based offset.
	
	* (v1.2.0) Fixed a bug that didn't allow reads larger than 35bp.
	  The 0-based and 1-based coordinates are now consistent. some out
	  commented code has been removed. Improved output format 1 "table;
	  per fragment". This includes that the file format has changed to
	  0-based (both start- and end positions). Also columns have been
	  added: positions relative to the gene annotation(s) for the "Full
	  genome alignment"-type analysis. The GTF/GFF parser now supports
	  "gene_id" column parsing. The mask file
	  share/annotations/ncRNA_annotation/ncrnadb09.gtf was using 0-based
	  cooridnates while the GTF/GFF format requires 1-based coordinates.
	  The fixed file is provided at:
	  share/annotations/ncRNA_annotation/ncrnadb09_v2.0.gtf

	* (v1.1.6) Fixed a GFF/GTF parsing error - FlaiMapper only supported
	  annotations with the score value set.
	
2015-03-20  Youri Hoogstrate
	* (v1.1.5) Removed warning written to stderr that should be reported
	  to stdout.
	
	* (v1.1.4) Tabix libraries from the pysam library have been replaced
	  with flaimapper libraries because of multiple incompatibility
	  issues.
	
	* (v1.1.3) Pysam 0.8.2.1 shows different behavior with the
	  TabixFile.fetch() function when no arguments are given. Flaimapper
	  has been made compatible also with the latest version of pysam.

	* (v1.1.2) Found and disabled an unnecessairy double exectution of a
	  'run' function which caused double calculation time.

2014-11-14  Youri Hoogstrate
	* (v1.1.1) Added "src/bin/gtf-from-fasta" and added the file to the
	  installer. This file makes it posible to create a mask file that
	  corresponds to a reference fasta file (only if mature ncRNAs are
	  given in the fasta file).
